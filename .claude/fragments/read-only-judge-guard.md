The only path you write is your own output artifact under `state/results/`,
which lives outside the worktree.

This is checked, not trusted: the dispatcher fingerprints the worktree before
you start and re-checks it after you return (`smith worktree verify`). A tree
that moved — new file, edited file, staged change, commit, branch switch —
discards your result and re-runs the pass on a clean worktree, so the one-line
edit does not save a round-trip, it costs the whole one.
